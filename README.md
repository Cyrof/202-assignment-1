# ICT202 Assignment 1: Explainable Machine Learning

## Running

First, ensure that you have the following requirements:

- Python `>= 3.11`
- Pipenv `>= 2023.2.0`

Then, run the following in your shell in the repository's root directory (i.e., the directory containing `Pipfile`):

```
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell jupyter-lab
```

The above should launch JupyterLab's web interface in your default browser.
Now, open the `explainable-ml.ipynb` file within the interface and run it to your heart's content!
